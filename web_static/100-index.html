            <p>I believe home is where you find peace, tranquility, joy, and most importantly were you feel safe. My home is a small place.
              I can start of by describing my kitchen. For a kitchen, it is small. It has two windows That the sunshine enters the house through them. The
              stove and refrigerator are right next to each other along with the sink.It has a small table of four chairs, but I only use two.
              The other two chairs are against the wall. On the ceiling there is a fan, which of course is pretty big. I love the fan because it helps
              keep the kitchen cool during those hot and humid summer days.</p>

            <p>The luxurious house that you have dreamt for years is a big house having a big back yard, swimming pool, and two floors.
              The house will also have parking lot; it can be used either to park the guestâ€™s motorcycle or to play badminton when it is vacant.
              The garage is on the left side of the house, while the door is on the right side where the wooden chair and table are located. The floor
              is made of ceramic with heating. In the first floor there are two bedrooms and bathrooms, living room, family room, dining room,
              and kitchen. In the second floor, there are three bedrooms (one of them where you will be staying), two bathrooms, warehouse, and balcony.
              There are also much furniture in the house including fancy lamps hanging on ceiling in each floor. The LED TV is located in the family room, while
              the refrigerator is in the kitchen. There is AC available in each room, except bathroom, kitchen, garage, and warehouse; the house has internet
              hotspot as well which makes it easier to browse everything and stay up-to-date. In the back yard of the house, there will be a swimming
              pool and gazebo, so that you and the other guests can enjoy free time over there. </p>
